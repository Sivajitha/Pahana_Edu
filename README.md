# Billing System

This is a  Bookshop Billing Management System developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL. The project is designed to manage books, customers, and billing operations. It allows the admin to log in, add new items, update existing records, generate bills, and manage the overall bookshop billing process. The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat and connected with a MySQL database. The system is built with Java on the backend, JSP and Servlets for handling requests, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. For data storage, a MySQL database is used, and JDBC is used for database connectivity. The project can be run easily on Apache Tomcat within IntelliJ IDEA . To set up the project, first clone the repository from GitHub and open it in your IDE. Then configure Apache Tomcat as the server. Create a MySQL database named `billing` and import the SQL file included in the project. After that, update the database username and password in the `DBConnection.java` file located inside the `src/util` folder. Once the configuration is done, run the project on Tomcat and access it through your web browser at `http://localhost:8080/Billing`. The folder structure is organized into model, dao, and util packages for Java classes, and a web folder containing the JSP files for the user interface. The database schema is provided in a separate `database.sql` file. For admin access, you can log in using the default credentials: username `Admin` and password `12345`. This project is created for educational purposes and demonstrates how to build a simple billing system using Java web technologies.
